As such, it has some dependencies that need to be built in the virtual environment before this repository can be run. Follow the steps below to complete this installation.</p> <ol> <li>Create a new Conda environment: <code>conda create -n BUQEYE python==3.9.16</code></li> <li>Activate the environment: <code>conda activate BUQEYE</code></li> <li>Download <code>jupyter notebook</code> through conda-forge via: <code>conda install -c conda-forge notebook</code></li> <li>Clone this repository by copying the link in the code tab above: <code>git clone https://github.com/asemposki/neutron-rich-bmm.git</code></li> <li>Navigate into the <code>neutron-rich-bmm</code> repository via: <code>cd neutron-rich-bmm</code></li> <li>Install the dependencies of this example via <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></li> <li>Within the above repository folder, git clone gsum: <code>git clone https://github.com/buqeye/gsum.git</code> and pip install this in gsum directory using <code>pip install .</code></li> <li>Also within the repository folder, git clone gptools: <code>git clone https://github.com/markchil/gptools.git</code> and pip install this in the gptools directory using <code>pip install .</code></li> <li>Still within this repository's main folder, git clone the nuclear-matter-convergence repo using <code>git clone https://github.com/buqeye/nuclear-matter-convergence.git</code> and <code>pip install .</code> within the nuclear-matter-convergence folder</li> <li>Lastly, git clone the BAND package <code>Taweret</code>: <code>git clone https://github.com/bandframework/Taweret.git</code> within the repository's main folder, as before, and install using <code>pip install .</code> in the <code>Taweret</code> directory</li> <li>Now that this is all done, you can test the structure by going into the <code>notebooks</code> folder and saying <code>jupyter notebook</code> in terminal, and this should load up the notebooks to be run. You should be all set!</li> </ol>"},{"location":"#navigation","title":"Navigation","text":""},{"location":"#notebooks","title":"Notebooks","text":"<p>This folder contains all of the notebooks that generate our results in our paper. </p>"},{"location":"#data","title":"data","text":"<p>All of our data is contained here.</p>"},{"location":"#src","title":"src","text":"<p>The source folder has all of the code written for this paper, including modified versions of open-source BUQEYE code from previous projects from the authors.</p>"},{"location":"#contacts","title":"Contacts","text":"<p>Authors: Alexandra C.
